    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <section>
      I am someone who will make sure the job gets done, even if it's not within that day I will make sure the job gets
      done before the deadline. I am very fond as well as interested in anything to do with a keyboard and mouse as I
      have been messing around with technology for as long as 18 years, I would very much like to see myself learn
      coding and even make websites in the future.
